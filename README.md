<h1>Project Title</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
    In the rapidly evolving landscape of online entertainment, there is a growing need for a centralized platform
    that seamlessly integrates diverse content types while ensuring efficient deployment and scalability.
    Addressing this, the project aims to overcome the challenges associated with content delivery, deployment, and
    management on an entertainment website.
</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
    The project revolves around the development of an entertainment website that leverages Azure services to
    streamline content deployment and enhance user experience. Utilizing Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure
    Container Instance (ACI), the platform ensures containerized, scalable, and efficient deployment of
    entertainment content, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing downtime.
</p>
<p>
    The core functionality of the entertainment website involves the storage of multimedia content in containers
    within Azure Container Registry. Azure Container Instances are then employed to dynamically orchestrate the
    deployment of these containers, ensuring rapid and responsive content delivery to end-users.
</p>

<h2>Core Technology Used</h2>
<p>
    The project heavily relies on two core Azure services:
    <ul>
        <li>Azure Container Registry (ACR): Provides a secure and scalable repository for storing and managing
            container images.</li>
        <li>Azure Container Instance (ACI): Enables the rapid deployment and scaling of containers without the need
            for managing underlying infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>AI Service Used</h2>
<p>
    To enhance user interaction and engagement, an AI Bot Service is integrated into the entertainment website.
    Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, the bot service facilitates personalized content
    recommendations, chat interactions, and a seamless user experience.
</p>

<h2>Other Technology Used</h2>
<p>
    In addition to Azure services, the project employs a combination of other technologies to ensure a robust and
    feature-rich entertainment platform:
    <ul>
        <li>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building an intuitive and responsive user interface.</li>
        <li>Backend: Node.js or other server-side technologies for managing content and user interactions.</li>
        <li>Database: Integration with a database system (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB) for efficient data storage and
            retrieval.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
